wow whoa that is some group of people thousands so nice thank you very much that's really nice thank you it's great to be at trump tower it's great to be in a wonderful city new york and it's an honor to have everybody here this is beyond anybody's expectations there's been no crowd like this and i can tell some of the candidates they went in they didn't know the air conditioner didn't work they sweated like dogs they didn't know the room was too big because they didn't have anybody there how are they going to beat isis i don't think it's gonna happen our country is in serious trouble we don't have victories anymore we used to have victories but we don't have them when was the last time anybody saw us beating let's say china in a trade deal they kill us i beat china all the time all the time when did we beat japan at anything they send their cars over by the millions and what do we do when was the last time you saw a chevrolet in tokyo it doesn't exist folks they beat us all the time when do we beat mexico at the border they're laughing at us at our stupidity and now they are beating us economically they are not our friend believe me but they're killing us economically the u s has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems thank you it's true and these are the best and the finest when mexico sends its people they're not sending their best they're not sending you they're not sending you they're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us they're bringing drugs they're bringing crime they're rapists and some i assume are good people but i speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting and it only makes common sense it only makes common sense they're sending us not the right people it's coming from more than mexico it's coming from all over south and latin america and it's coming probablyâ probablyâ from the middle east but we don't know because we have no protection and we have no competence we don't know what's happening and it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the middle east they've become rich i'm in competition with them they just built a hotel in syria can you believe this they built a hotel when i have to build a hotel i pay interest they don't have to pay interest because they took the oil that when we left iraq i said we should've taken so now isis has the oil and what they don't have iran has and in 19â and i will tell you this and i said it very strongly years ago i saidâ and i love the military and i want to have the strongest military that we've ever had and we need it more now than ever but i said don't hit iraq because you're going to totally destabilize the middle east iran is going to take over the middle east iran and somebody else will get the oil and it turned out that iran is now taking over iraq think of it iran is taking over iraq and they're taking it over big league we spent 2 trillion in iraq 2 trillion we lost thousands of lives thousands in iraq we have wounded soldiers who i love i love they're great all over the place thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers and we have nothing we can't even go there we have nothing and every time we give iraq equipment the first time a bullet goes off in the air they leave it last week i read 2 300 humveesâ these are big vehiclesâ were left behind for the enemy 2 000 you would say maybe two maybe four 2 300 sophisticated vehicles they ran and the enemy took them last quarter it was just announced our gross domestic productâ a sign of strength right but not for us it was below zero whoever heard of this it's never below zero our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978 but think of it gdp below zero horrible labor participation rate and our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent don't believe the 5 6 don't believe it that's right a lot of people up there can't get jobs they can't get jobs because there are no jobs because china has our jobs and mexico has our jobs they all have jobs but the real number the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent and nobody talks about it because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way and we as a country are getting weaker even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work it came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old they don't know if it worked and i thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television because boy does that send signals to putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say that is a group of people and that is a nation that truly has no clue they don't know what they're doing they don't know what they're doing we have a disaster called the big lie obamacare obamacare yesterday it came out that costs are going for people up 29 39 49 and even 55 percent and deductibles are through the roof you have to be hit by a tractor literally a tractor to use it because the deductibles are so high it's virtually useless it's virtually useless it is a disaster and remember the 5 billion website 5 billion we spent on a website and to this day it doesn't work a 5 billion website i have so many websites i have them all over the place i hire people they do a website it costs me 3 5 billion website well you need somebody because politicians are all talk no action nothing's gonna get done they will not bring usâ believe meâ to the promised land they will not as an example i've been on the circuit making speeches and i hear my fellow republicans and they're wonderful people i like them they all want me to support them they don't know how to bring it about they come up to my office i'm meeting with three of them in the next week and they don't knowâ are you running are you not running could we have your support what do we do how do we do it i like them and i hear their speeches and they don't talk jobs and they don't talk china when was the last time you heard china is killing us they're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe it makes it impossible for our companies to compete impossible they're killing us but you don't hear that from anybody else you don't hear it from anybody else and i watch the speeches i watch the speeches of these people and they say the sun will rise the moon will set all sorts of wonderful things will happen and people are saying what's going on i just want a job just get me a job i don't need the rhetoric i want a job and that's what's happening and it's going to get worse because remember obamacare really kicks in in '16 2016 obama is going to be out playing golf he might be on one of my courses i would invite him i actually would say i have the best courses in the world so i'd say you what if he wants toâ i have one right next to the white house right on the potomac if he'd like to play that's fine in fact i'd love him to leave early and play that would be a very good thing but obamacare kicks in in 2016 really big league it is going to be amazingly destructive doctors are quitting i have a friend who's a doctor and he said to me the other day donald i never saw anything like it i have more accountants than i have nurses it's a disaster my patients are beside themselves they had a plan that was good they have no plan now we have to repeal obamacare and it can beâ andâ and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody let it be for everybody but much better and much less expensive for people and for the government and we can do it so i've watched the politicians i've dealt with them all my life if you can't make a good deal with a politician then there's something wrong with you you're certainly not very good and that's what we have representing us they will never make america great again they don't even have a chance they're controlled fullyâ they're controlled fully by the lobbyists by the donors and by the special interests fully yes they control them hey i have lobbyists i have to tell you i have lobbyists that can produce anything for me they're great but you know what it won't happen it won't happen because we have to stop doing things for some people but for this country it's destroying our country we have to stop and it has to stop now now our country needsâ our country needs a truly great leader and we need a truly great leader now we need a leader that wrote the art of the deal we need a leader that can bring back our jobs can bring back our manufacturing can bring back our military can take care of our vets our vets have been abandoned and we also need a cheerleader you know when president obama was elected i said well the one thing i think he'll do well i think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country i think he'd be a great spirit he was vibrant he was young i really thought that he would be a great cheerleader he's not a leader that's true you're right about that but he wasn't a cheerleader he's actually a negative force he's been a negative force he wasn't a cheerleader he was the opposite we need somebody that can take the brand of the united states and make it great again it's not great again we needâ we need somebodyâ we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again we can do that and i will tell you i love my life i have a wonderful family they're saying dad you're going to do something that's going to be so tough you know all of my life i've heard that a truly successful person a really really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office just can't happen and yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again so ladies and gentlemen i am officially running for president of the united states and we are going to make our country great again it can happen our country has tremendous potential we have tremendous people we have people that aren't working we have people that have no incentive to work but they're going to have incentive to work because the greatest social program is a job and they'll be proud and they'll love it and they'll make much more than they would've ever made and they'll beâ they'll be doing so well and we're going to be thriving as a country thriving it can happen i will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created i tell you that i'll bring back our jobs from china from mexico from japan from so many places i'll bring back our jobs and i'll bring back our money right now think of this we owe china 1 3 trillion we owe japan more than that so they come in they take our jobs they take our money and then they loan us back the money and we pay them in interest and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better how stupid are our leaders how stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen how stupid are they i'm going to tell youâ thank you i'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade because i'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons number one the people negotiating don't have a clue our president doesn't have a clue he's a bad negotiator he's the one that did bergdahl we get bergdahl they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there we get bergdahl we get a traitor we get a no good traitor and they get the five people that they wanted for years and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us that's the negotiator we have take a look at the deal he's making with iran he makes that deal israel maybe won't exist very long it's a disaster and we have to protect israel but so we need peopleâ i'm a free trader but the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you if you don't have talented people if you don't have great leadership if you don't have people that know business not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign which is the way all jobs just about are gotten free trade terrible free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people but we have people that are stupid we have people that aren't smart and we have people that are controlled by special interests and it's just not going to work so here's a couple of stories happened recently a friend of mine is a great manufacturer and you know china comes over and they dump all their stuff and i buy it i buy it because frankly i have an obligation to buy it because they devalue their currency so brilliantly they just did it recently and nobody thought they could do it again but with all our problems with russia with all our problems with everythingâ everything they got away with it again and it's impossible for our people here to compete so i want to tell you this story a friend of mine who's a great manufacturer calls me up a few weeks ago he's very upset i said what's your problem he said you know i make great product and i said i know i know that because i buy the product he said i can't get it into china they won't accept it i sent a boat over and they actually sent it back they talked about environmental they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it i said oh wait a minute that's terrible does anyone know this he said yeah they do it all the time with other people i said they send it back yeah so i finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff they're not supposed to be doing that i told them now they do charge you tariff on trucks when we send trucks and other things over there ask boeing they wanted boeing's secrets they wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from boeing hey i'm not saying they're stupid i like china i sell apartments forâ i just sold an apartment for 15 million to somebody from china am i supposed to dislike them i own a big chunk of the bank of america building at 1290 avenue of the americas that i got from china in a war very valuable i love china the biggest bank in the world is from china you know where their united states headquarters is located in this building in trump tower i love china people say oh you don't like china no i love them but their leaders are much smarter than our leaders and we can't sustain ourself with that there's too muchâ it's likeâ it's like take the new england patriots and tom brady and have them play your high school football team that's the difference between china's leaders and our leaders they are ripping us we are rebuilding china we're rebuilding many countries china you go there now roads bridges schools you never saw anything like it they have bridges that make the george washington bridge look like small potatoes and they're all over the place we have all the cards but we don't know how to use them we don't even know that we have the cards because our leaders don't understand the game we could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly now they're going militarily they're building a military island in the middle of the south china sea a military island now our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance and the environmentalist wouldn't let our countryâ we would never build in an ocean they built it in about one year this massive military port they're building up their military to a point that is very scary you have a problem with isis you have a bigger problem with china and in my opinion the new china believe it or not in terms of trade is mexico so this man tells me about the manufacturing i say that's a terrible story i hate to hear it but i have another one ford so mexico takes a company a car company that was going to build in tennessee rips it out everybody thought the deal was dead reported it in the wall street journal recently everybody thought it was a done deal it's going in and that's going to be it going into tennessee great state great people all of a sudden at the last moment this big car manufacturer foreign announces they're not going to tennessee they're gonna spend their 1 billion in mexico instead not good now ford announces a few weeks ago that ford is going to build a 2 5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in mexico 2 5 billion it's going to be one of the largest in the world ford good company so i announced that i'm running for president i would one of the early things i would do probably before i even got inâ and i wouldn't even useâ you know i haveâ i know the smartest negotiators in the world i know the good ones i know the bad ones i know the overrated ones you get a lot of them that are overrated they're not good they think they are they get good stories because the newspapers get buffaloed but they're not good but i know the negotiators in the world and i put them one for each country believe me folks we will do very very well very very well but i wouldn't even waste my time with this one i would call up the head of ford who i know if i was president i'd say congratulations i understand that you're building a nice 2 5 billion car factory in mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the united states zero tax just flow them across the border and you say to yourself how does that help us right how does that help us where is that good it's not so i would say congratulations that's the good news let me give you the bad news every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border we're going to charge you a 35 percent tax and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction and that's it now here's what is going to happen if it's not me in the position it's one of these politicians that we're running against you know the 400 people that we're inaudible and here's what's going to happen they're not so stupid they know it's not a good thing and they may even be upset by it but then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for ford and say you can't do that to ford because ford takes care of me and i take care of you and you can't do that to ford and guess what no problem they're going to build in mexico they're going to take away thousands of jobs it's very bad for us so under president trump here's what would happen the head of ford will call me back i would say within an hour after i told them the bad news but it could be he'd want to be cool and he'll wait until the next day you know they want to be a little cool and he'll say please please please he'll beg for a little while and i'll say no interest then he'll call all sorts of political people and i'll say sorry fellas no interest because i don't need anybody's money it's nice i don't need anybody's money i'm using my own money i'm not using the lobbyists i'm not using donors i don't care i'm really rich i inaudible and by the way i'm not even saying that's the kind of mindset that's the kind of thinking you need for this country soâ because we got to make the country rich it sounds crass somebody said oh that's crass it's not crass we got 18 trillion in debt we got nothing but problems we got a military that needs equipment all over the place we got nuclear weapons that are obsolete we've got nothing we've got social security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country all these other people want to cut the hell out of it i'm not going to cut it at all i'm going to bring money in and we're going to save it but here's what's going to happen after i'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns after i'm called by all of the special interests and by theâ the donors and by the lobbyistsâ and they have zero chance at convincing me zeroâ i'll get a call the next day from the head of ford he'll say please reconsider i'll say no he'll say mr president we've decided to move the plant back to the united states and we're not going to build it in mexico that's it they have no choice they have no choice there are hundreds of things like that i'll give you another example saudi arabia they make 1 billion a day 1 billion a day i love the saudis many are in this building they make a billion dollars a day whenever they have problems we send over the ships we say we're gonna protect what are we doing they've got nothing but money if the right person asked them they'd pay a fortune they wouldn't be there except for us and believe me you look at the border with yemen you remember obama a year ago yemen was a great victory two weeks later the place was blown up everybody got outâ and they kept our equipment they always keep our equipment we ought to send used equipment right they always keep our equipment we ought to send some real junk because frankly it would beâ we ought to send our surplus we're always losing this gorgeous brand new stuff but look at that border with saudi arabia do you really think that these people are interested in yemen saudi arabia without us is gone they're gone and i'm the one that made all of the right predictions about iraq you know all of these politicians that i'm running against nowâ it's so nice to say i'm running as opposed to if i run if i run i'm running but all of these politicians that i'm running against now they're trying to disassociate i mean you looked at bush it took him five days to answer the question on iraq he couldn't answer the question he didn't know i said is he intelligent then i looked at rubio he was unable to answer the question is iraq a good thing or bad thing he didn't know he couldn't answer the question how are these people gonna lead us how are we gonnaâ how are we gonna go back and make it great again we can't they don't have a clue they can't lead us they can't they can't even answer simple questions it was terrible but saudi arabia is in big big trouble now thanks to fracking and other things the oil is all over the place and i used to say it there are ships at sea and this was during the worst crisis that were loaded up with oil and the cartel kept the price up because again they were smarter than our leaders they were smarter than our leaders there is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again and therefore make it great again because we need money we're dying we're dying we need money we have to do it and we need the right people so ford will come back they'll all come back and i will say this this is going to be an election in my opinion that's based on competence somebody said thank you darlin' somebody said to me the other day a reporter a very nice reporter but mr trump you're not a nice person that's true but actually i am i think i am a nice person people that know me like me does my family like me i think so right look at my family i'm proud of my family by the way speaking of my family melania barron kai donnie don vanessa tiffany evanka did a great job did she do a great job great jared laura and eric i'm very proud of my family they're a great family so the reporter said to me the other day but mr trump you're not a nice person how can you get people to vote for you i said i don't know i said i think that number one i am a nice person i give a lot of money away to charities and other things i think i'm actually a very nice person but i said this is going to be an election that's based on competence because people are tired of these nice people and they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world and they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita than any nation in the world and we are 26th in the world 25 countries are better than us in education and some of them are like third world countries but we're becoming a third word country because of our infrastructure our airports our roads everything so one of the things i did and i said you know what i'll do i'll do it because a lot of people said he'll never run number one he won't want to give up his lifestyle they're right about that but i'm doing it number two i'm a private company so nobody knows what i'm worth and the one thing is that when you run you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth so i said that's ok i'm proud of my net worth i've done an amazing job i started offâ thank youâ i started off in a small office with my father in brooklyn and queens and my father said and i love my father i learned so much he was a great negotiator i learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors but i learned a lot but he used to say donald don't go into manhattan that's the big leagues we don't know anything about that don't do it i said i gotta go into manhattan i gotta build those big buildings i gotta do it dad i've gotta do it and after four or five years in brooklyn i ventured into manhattan and did a lot of great dealsâ the grand hyatt hotel i was responsible for the convention center on the west side i did a lot of great deals and i did them early and young and now i'm building all over the world and i love what i'm doing but they all said a lot of the pundits on television well donald will never run and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks so i said to myself you know nobody's ever going to know unless i run because i'm really proud of my success i really am i've employedâ i've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime that means medical that means education that means everything so a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months because it's big and complex and they've put together a statement a financial statement just a summary but everything will be filed eventually with the government and we don't use extensions or anything we'll be filing it right on time we don't need anything and it was even reported incorrectly yesterday because they said he had assets of 9 billion so i said no that's the wrong number that's the wrong number not assets so they put together this and before i say it i have to say this i made it the old fashioned way it's real estate you know it's real estate it's labor and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions and it's all over the place and building all over the world and i have assetsâ big accounting firm one of the most highly respectedâ 9 billion 240 million dollars and i have liabilities of about 500 million that's long term debt very low interest rates in fact one of the big banks came to me and said donald you don't have enough borrowings could we loan you 4 billion i said i don't need it i don't want it and i've been there i don't want it but in two seconds they give me whatever i wanted so i have a total net worth and now with the increase it'll be well over 10 billion but here a total net worth ofâ net worth not assets notâ a net worth after all debt after all expenses the greatest assetsâ trump tower 1290 avenue of the americas bank of america building in san francisco 40 wall street sometimes referred to as the trump building right opposite the new yorkâ many other places all over the world so the total is 8 737 540 00 now i'm not doing that i'm not doing that to brag because you know what i don't have to brag i don't have to believe it or not i'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs we need that thinking we have the opposite thinking we have losers we have losers we have people that don't have it we have people that are morally corrupt we have people that are selling this country down the drain so i put together this statement and the only reason i'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going because if we have another three or four yearsâ you know we're at 8 trillion now we're soon going to be at 20 trillion according to the economistsâ who i'm not big believers in but nevertheless this is what they're sayingâ that 24 trillionâ we're very closeâ that's the point of no return 24 trillion we will be there soon that's when we become greece that's when we become a country that's unsalvageable and we're gonna be there very soon we're gonna be there very soon so just to sum up i would do various things very quickly i would repeal and replace the big lie obamacare i would build a great wall and nobody builds walls better than me believe me and i'll build them very inexpensively i will build a great great wall on our southern border and i will have mexico pay for that wall mark my words nobody would be tougher on isis than donald trump nobody i will find within our military i will find the general patton or i will find general macarthur i will find the right guy i will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work nobody nobody will be pushing us around i will stop iran from getting nuclear weapons and we won't be using a man like secretary kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation who's making a horrible and laughable deal who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old and falls and breaks his leg i won't be doing that and i promise i will never be in a bicycle race that i can tell you i will immediately terminate president obama's illegal executive order on immigration immediately fully support and back up the second amendment now it's very interesting today i heard it through stupidity in a very very hard core prison interestingly named clinton two vicious murderers two vicious people escaped and nobody knows where they are and a woman was on television this morning and she said you know mr trump and she was telling other people and i actually called her and she said you know mr trump i always was against guns i didn't want guns and now since this happened â it's up in the prison areaâ my husband and i are finally in agreement because he wanted the guns we now have a gun on every table we're ready to start shooting i said very interesting so protect the second amendment endâ end common core common core shouldâ it is a disaster bush is totally in favor of common core i don't see how he can possibly get the nomination he's weak on immigration he's in favor of common core how the hell can you vote for this guy you just can't do it we have to end education has to be local rebuild the country's infrastructure nobody can do that like me believe me it will be done on time on budget way below cost way below what anyone ever thought i look at the roads being built all over the country and i say i can build those things for one third what they do is unbelievable how bad you know we're building on pennsylvania avenue the old post office we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels it's gonna be the best hotel in washington d c we got it from the general services administration in washington the obama administration we got it it was the most highly sought afterâ or one of them but i think the most highly sought after project in the history of general services we got it people were shocked trump got it well i got it for two reasons number one we're really good number two we had a really good plan and i'll add in the third we had a great financial statement because the general services who are terrific people by the way and talented people they wanted to do a great job and they wanted to make sure it got built so we have to rebuild our infrastructure our bridges our roadways our airports you come into la guardia airport it's like we're in a third world country you look at the patches and the 40 year old floor they throw down asphalt and they throw you look at these airports we are like a third world country and i come in from china and i come in from qatar and i come in from different places and they have the most incredible airports in the world you come to back to this country and you have lax disaster you have all of these disastrous airports we have to rebuild our infrastructure save medicare medicaid and social security without cuts have to do it get rid of the fraud get rid of the waste and abuse but save it people have been paying it for years and now many of these candidates want to cut it you save it by making the united states by making us rich again by taking back all of the money that's being lost renegotiate our foreign trade deals reduce our 18 trillion in debt because believe me we're in a bubble we have artificially low interest rates we have a stock market that frankly has been good to me but i still hate to see what's happening we have a stock market that is so bloated be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens so be very very careful and strengthen our military and take care of our vets so so important sadly the american dream is dead but if i get elected president i will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before and we will make america great again thank you thank you very much
